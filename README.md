# In-House Underwriting Model

This project is an in-house machine learning underwriting system designed to replicate and replace the functionality currently provided by third-party services like Underwrite.ai. It processes application data and returns a risk score and decision (`Accept` or `Deny`) in under 60 seconds.

## üîç Goal

- Predict risk scores (0‚Äì1) based on applicant data
- Return a decision (`Accept` or `Deny`) using a threshold
- Allow customizable weighting of criteria
- Ensure explainability (via SHAP or similar tools)
- Support future retraining and performance improvement
- Integrate with the current system (e.g. IntroXL, LoanTill)
